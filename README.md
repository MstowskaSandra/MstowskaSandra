### 🖐 Hi, I’m Sandra!

🎯 I’m a self-taught developer from Poland, who swapped a dog-leash for a keyboard and set out to become a frontend developer.

💻 I work with **JavaScript**, and **React.js** – bringing ideas to life with creativity, enthusiasm, and a love for building beautiful, responsive UIs 🎨✨

🐶 I ran my own dog training school for 5 years as a certified canine behaviorist – now I dream of building an app to help dog owners train their pups 🐕📱

🌍 In my free time, you’ll find me hiking mountain trails with my dog or exploring new places.

🚀 I’m currently looking for my first opportunity in tech – eager to learn, grow, and build great things as a frontend developer!

## 🧠 Mentoring
I have been actively participating in a frontend development mentoring program since July 2025, which allows me to
